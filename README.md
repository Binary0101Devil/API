# Postman Endpoints to Excel

## üìå Overview

This script allows you to extract all API endpoints from a Postman collection and export them into an Excel file for easy reference and documentation. It parses the exported Postman collection JSON and captures each request‚Äôs **name, HTTP method, and URL**, including endpoints inside nested folders.

The output is saved as `postman_endpoints.xlsx`, which can be shared across teams, used for audits, or included in API documentation.
